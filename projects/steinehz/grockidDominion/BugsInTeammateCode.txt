All tests ran on the flip ENGR server. Bugs were found by the failing print statemnets of each test. 

Bug 1:

	The first bug I found is in the smithy card. I found this bug because it broke an assert.
		"handCount == g->handCount[i]"
	After fixing the code so that there was no assert to fail, I found that the number of cards was always 1 more than it should have been.
	This happened for all test cases.
	Therefore smithy must be handing out too many cards to the player every time its action is run. 
	Looking at the smithy code, it looks like a for loop was given the wrong number to count up to.

Bug 2:
	
	The second bug is for the adventurer card. Both the unit test and random test for adventurer found issues with this card.
	When unit test ran, found that handcount, deck count and score were all off. 
	When random test ran, found the same issues and that the second card picked up was not a treasure card in some cases.

Bug 3:
	
	The third bug is in council room. When that function is run it gets thrown into an infinite loop. 
	This happens for both the unit and random test. Check all loops for this function. 

Bug 4:
	
	The fourth bug is in great hall. The number of actions added after running great hall is incorrect every time.
